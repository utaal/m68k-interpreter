This repo contains a work-in-progress m68k interpreter in Scala stemmed from
the desire to experiment with Scala's LL(*) parser combinators and to try out
purely functional techniques that can emulate a stateful imperative computation.

No usable user interface is available yet but the tests can be run with
    
    sbt test
